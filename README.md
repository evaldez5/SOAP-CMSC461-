## Overview
Government agencies are assigned space by the General Services Administration (GSA).
The GSA requires an occupancy agreement with each agency before formal space assignments
are made, and before any allocation of funding for space is granted the customer agency. Each
government agency must conclude an occupancy agreement before the GSA makes any
contractual commitments for the agency's space request. The System for Occupancy Agreement
Processing is an application that captures the relational model between GSA offices, customer
agencies and occupancy agreements.
